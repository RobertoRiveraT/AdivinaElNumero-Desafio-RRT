# AdivinaElNumero-Desafio-RRT - Flutter Challenge

This is a small interactive game developed in Flutter Web as part of a technical assessment. The goal is to guess a secret number within a range that varies depending on the selected difficulty level. The game includes input validation, state management, game history, and a UI adapted for mobile experiences.
